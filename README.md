## My Sparks Foundation Project - Donation Platform with Razorpay Integration

**Overview:**
This is my Sparks Foundation projectâ€”a user-friendly donation platform built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The homepage sports a friendly "Donate" button, leading to a payment page powered by Razorpay for secure donations. After contributing, an email confirmation and receipt magically appear in your inbox. Testing was a breeze with Razorpay's sandbox accounts. Join me in spreading good vibes by making a hassle-free donation!

**Tech Stack:**
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Razorpay API

**How to Contribute:**
1. Hit the "Donate" button.
2. Pick your donation amount.
3. Enjoy the warm feeling of making a difference!

**Note:**
This project is a spark of kindness in collaboration with the Sparks Foundation :)
